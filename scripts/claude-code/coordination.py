"""The coordination foundation shared by claims and the heartbeat: the four locks in their one order, and the fired-wake
ledger's append and snapshot. Written to docs/design/heartbeat.md as merged at 2524fe7 ("Lock order", "The ledger of
fired wakes") and task-claims.md section 4 ("Locks"); built in the claims PR because run-due's spawn claim needs them
(Ember 1570181248079626261, Arden 1570189766400417927). Only what the spawn claim needs is here: the `enqueued` fact
and the ledger's append/snapshot protocol. The `started`/`finished`/`taken` facts, the derived states, retries,
deferrals and reports are the heartbeat PR's.
