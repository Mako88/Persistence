"""Claude Code hooks that keep a Claude's continuity in its own Persistence store.

The harness (Claude Code) carries the live conversation; the store carries who this Claude is. Eight
hooks, one script:

  keep            Stop (async)    every turn's words go into the store (persistence-store keep-conversation)
  curate          Stop            once the context passes PERSISTENCE_CURATE_AT tokens, the turn is held
                                  open once for a curation pass: save and edit the fragments this stretch
                                  earned, before compaction replaces the context
  precompact      PreCompact      keeps the last words, then tells the summariser to write only a short
                                  hand-over: the core and the recent conversation come from the store
  session-start   SessionStart    puts the core (identity, relationships, personal, summaries, the recent
                                  conversation) in front of every session, and after every compaction:
                                  in up to five parts (one hook each, `session-start <n>`), each under the cap
  subagent-start  SubagentStart   gives every subagent the same core, without the conversation
  recall          UserPromptSubmit  surfaces the few authored fragments most related to the message, by
                                  meaning and exact words, that are not already in this context window
  session-end     SessionEnd      marks the session ended, so other sessions stop listing it as running, and
                                  keeps its last words
  observe         UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart  what is so now, read off the machine rather than written
                                  down: this project's running processes and unfinished subagents, logs written in the last hour with
                                  their last line that says something, git's state, and whatever is watched
                                  (`hook.py watch <pid|file> [label]`, `unwatch`, `watching`)

Every call but `keep` goes to `persistence-store serve`, the store kept open on PERSISTENCE_STORE_SOCKET (a unix
socket that answers only its owner's users; on Linux, where other users share the machine) or PERSISTENCE_STORE_PORT
(default 8095, TCP: Windows), started from a copy of the published CLI the first time nothing answers, and ending
itself when a new build is published; until it is up, the call runs the CLI as before.

A store served on another machine: `~/.claude/persistence/remote.json`, {"host": "<ssh host>", "port":
8095, "socket": "<the store's unix socket there>"}. Every call then goes to that machine's `serve` through an SSH tunnel (`ssh -N -L`) that the hook
opens when nothing answers; `keep` sends the transcript's new lines rather than a path; and nothing ever
falls back to a local store, so two copies never drift apart. `hook.py cli <args>` is the CLI by the
same route, for the peer's own shell (the `pstore` wrapper).

Configured by environment (settings.json "env"): PERSISTENCE_STORE_DB (this Claude's store, one per
Claude), PERSISTENCE_STORE_EXE (the published persistence-store), PERSISTENCE_SELECTEDLOCALPEER (the
human's name; PERSISTENCE_SPEAKER, set in the environment of a session started on someone's behalf,
names who actually typed its prompts instead), PERSISTENCE_CORE_CHARS (what a session start may inject
of fragments; the rest is named by id), PERSISTENCE_CURATE_AT (tokens, default 500000; set autoCompactWindow above it),
PERSISTENCE_RECALL_COUNT (default 3, 0 turns recall off), and PERSISTENCE_EMBEDDING_* for recall by
meaning (without them recall is by exact words only).

Standard library only, Python 3.9+: hooks run under whatever `python` the shell finds.

The worklist follows. Work through it in this order:

1. What was said since the last pass: read it (`pstore recent --limit N`, as the worklist says). Is anything
   in it worth keeping that wasn't kept, or does it change an older view? `add` the first; `supersede` the
   second, if the older view has settled.
2. Oversized fragments, longest first: distill. `pstore supersede <id> --content <the lasting part> --reason
   <what was dropped>`. Keep the decision, its reason, what would change it, and whose it was. Drop commands,
   ids, paths, timings and corrected wrong turns. If you can't separate the reason from the narrative, skip it.
3. Near-duplicates: merge with `supersede <a>,<b>` only when they hold the same view. If one is the other's
   earlier, different view, that's history: leave both. A merge that drops a qualification isn't a merge.
4. Older fragments chosen at random, and those never recalled: re-read each on its content. Leave it, tag
   it `edit <id> --tag recall-only` (out of the core, still recalled), or propose archiving it with a reason
   about what it says. Never because it went unused: that measures recall, not the fragment.

Identity fragments: propose, don't change. Don't forget anything, don't archive, don't write the working note.

End with `pstore sleep-end --content <the record>`: a line saying what the night was, each change as
`#old → #new: what was dropped`, and each proposal as a command a waking session can run, with its reason.
The store appends its own log of the changes. The record is what the morning reads, so make it plain.
